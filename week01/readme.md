## Project 1

+ Print out a street map of Oberlin, place a glass, rim down, anywhere on the map, and draw round its edge. Pick up the map, go out into town, and walk the circle, keeping as close as you can to the curve. Record the experience as you go, in whatever medium you favour: film, photograph, manuscript, tape. Catch the textual run-off of the streets; the graffiti, the branded litter, the snatches of conversation. Cut for sign. Log the data-stream. Be alert to the happenstance of metaphors, watch for visual rhymes, coincidences, analogies, family resemblances, the changing moods of the street. Complete the circle, and the record ends. Walking makes for content; footage for footage.

+ Due Wednesday. Bring in your story and something to present in 5 minutes (sounds, images, etc)
