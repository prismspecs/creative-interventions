# Monday

+ Discuss Final Projects
	+ Looking back at past projects
	+ May 10 Art Walk
	+ Expectations for final
		+ Spending more time completing this work than others
		+ Working with intention
		+ You can either expand upon an existing work or produce something entirely new
		+ Collaborations are great, but I expect more time and effort if you do choose this route
		+ Start early! Think about the "Unnoticed" project and how things improved when given enough time versus last minute projects
		+ If you'd like to go over something specific to support your project, get access to the wood shop, rent a projector, etc. please do so ASAP
	+ Be prepared to discuss your ideas for final projects on Wednesday for a group discussion/brainstorm

+ Finish projections
