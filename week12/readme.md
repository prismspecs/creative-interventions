+ Discuss Final Projects
	+ Looking back at past projects
	+ May 10 Art Walk
	+ Expectations for final
		+ Spending more time completing this work than others
		+ Working with intention
		+ You can either expand upon an existing work or produce something entirely new
		+ Collaborations are great, but I expect more time and effort if you do choose this route
		+ Start early! Think about the "Unnoticed" project and how things improved when given enough time versus last minute projects
		+ If you'd like to go over something specific to support your project, get access to the wood shop, rent a projector, etc. please do so ASAP
	+ Be prepared to discuss your ideas for final projects on Wednesday for a group discussion/brainstorm

+ Finish projections

# Wednesday

+ Brainstorm/discuss final projects
	+ Come up with 15 Oberlin locations that are only understandable through familiarity
		+ e.g., "Under Mudd", "Above" Subway, Ottica, etc., that hut in the forest
	+ 15 interfaces
		+ e.g., work order stickies, painting the rocks, classifieds
	+ 15 activities pertaining to Oberlin~
		+ Taxidermy, jazz, Obiegame, #froggerIRL
	+ 1 minute, 1 random combination, 20 minutes
+ Narrowing parameters - Final projects must:
	+ Deal with some aspect of Oberlin culture or site specificity
	+ Include others as participants, whether knowingly or unknowingly
	+ Be well documented
	+ Be wholistic, intentional, and subversive

+ Back to discussions--
