# raw thoughts pre-outline

+ Context
  + Soviet art, Soviet socialism
		+ On December 25, 1991, the Soviet hammer and sickle flag lowered for the last time over the Kremlin, thereafter replaced by the Russian tricolor. Earlier in the day, Mikhail Gorbachev resigned his post as president of the Soviet Union, leaving Boris Yeltsin as president of the newly independent Russian state.

	+ American abstract expressionism
    + Pollock and the CIA
			+ From The Indepdent:
				+ The Central Intelligence Agency used American modern art - including the works of such artists as Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell, Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko - as a weapon in the Cold War. In the manner of a Renaissance prince - except that it acted secretly - the CIA fostered and promoted American Abstract Expressionist painting around the world for more than 20 years.

				+ The connection is improbable. This was a period, in the 1950s and 1960s, when the great majority of Americans disliked or even despised modern art - President Truman summed up the popular view when he said: "If that's art, then I'm a Hottentot." As for the artists themselves, many were ex- communists barely acceptable in the America of the McCarthyite era, and certainly not the sort of people normally likely to receive US government backing.

				+ Why did the CIA support them? Because in the propaganda war with the Soviet Union, this new artistic movement could be held up as proof of the creativity, the intellectual freedom, and the cultural power of the US. Russian art, strapped into the communist ideological straitjacket, could not compete.

  + America didn't become super relevant in the world stage of culture until after the first World War, and didn't become dominant in this regard until after the second world war

  + The history of Western art, of course, was centered in Europe. And the center of abstract expressionism, the newest and most important art movement of the 1900s was centered in Russia

  + The reception of American art in opposition to that of the USSR was thought to be so important that the CIA made it a guiding principal when it was founded in 1947

  + Once the Soviet Union dissolved the artists there went from being at the center of cultural production to irrelevant, as the market became the deciding factor in the relevance of culture in place of art historians or alternative economic models (such as with the USSR)

  + This leads to artists coming out of a historic avant-garde tradition in drastically shifting cultural paradigms, challenging the supremacy of an emerging market-driven art

+ Art Vandalism case studies
  + Oleg Kulik
    + From wiki: For his performances, Kulik creates a symbolic set of parameters to define the environment which he will inhabit in the persona of a dog, and then devises a series of actions that unfold as a response. The artist describes the dialogue within his practice as "a conscious falling out of the human horizon" which places him on hands and knees. His intention is to describe what he sees as a crisis of contemporary culture, a result of an overly refined cultural language which creates barriers between individuals. Thus, he simplifies his performance language to half of the basic emotional vocabulary of a domestic animal.
    + At the Interpol group exhibition in Stockholm in 1996, he performed in the gallery chained next to a sign labelled 'dangerous'. An international scandal occurred when he not only attacked members of the public who chose to ignore the sign, in one case biting a man, but also attacked other artworks within the exhibition, partially destroying some pieces made by other artists.
    + Kulik thought this was an excusable act, as there was a warning label attached to his performance which people chose to disregard, reasoning that his intention was to divulge his angst at the current cultural crisis through the violent anger of a dog.
    + The incident inspired a scene in the 2017 film The Square directed by Ruben Östlund, where animal actor Terry Notary plays a performance artist who imitates an ape.

  + Voina
    + Voina is a group of Russian artists that engages in radical street protest actions. The group was founded bin 2006. The group doesn’t cooperate on principle with any of Russian curators, nor gallerists, state or private institutions. More than 20 criminal cases have been brought against the group. In 2010-2011 two activists of the Voina were detained in jail for 3.5 months under accusation of inciting hatred towards the police by means of the art-actions. They were released from custody, as artist Banksy bailed them out. Voina member Taisiya Osipova was arrested at 2010 and got 8-year sentence.

    + Blue Bucket via Creative Time http://creativetime.org/summit/2011/09/23/voina
      + Nikolayev—who was nicknamed “Crazy Lenya” by his fellow activists—is remembered for his brave actions during the group’s 2010 Blue Bucket protests, in which he sprinted across a busy street wearing a blue bucket atop his head. The bucket was a symbol of the blue flashing beacons Russian government officials often place atop their vehicles in order to cut through traffic, often causing accidents and killing pedestrians along the way.

      + According to a tribute to Nikolayev posted on Voina’s blog, he “walked in the traffic lanes on Moscow’s busiest streets.  He blindly moved against traffic, ignoring the speed limits and obstructing public transportation.” During one protest, he climbed on top of a government official’s car. The car’s driver got out and knocked the bucket off of his head—only to reveal a second blue bucket underneath.

  + Brener
    + In 1997, Alexander Brener walked into the Stedelijk Museum of Art in Amsterdam with a concealed can of green spray paint and scrawled a dollar symbol onto Malevich's famous painting Suprematism
    + He was quickly apprehended by guards and exclaimed that it was an act of performance art in dialogue with the original artist
    + The value of the painting dropped from 7.5 to 5 million USD following the act

    + Shafrazi
      + In 1977 Tony Shafrazi spray painted "KILL LIES ALL" on Picasso's Guernica and was subsequently arrested. He now owns a successful gallery in New York City in which he buys and sells Picassos

  + How should we intepret Brener's actions?
    + What is "Art Vandalism"?
      + Simple categorizing Brener (and the other artists mentioned) as a vandal, his act merely damaging private property, seems insufficient given the history of art in which similar acts are regarded as culturally important. Banksy, Ai Weiwei, Keith Harring, to name a few examples
      + In 2009, M.J. Williams published a paper in the Brooklyn Law Review seeking to create just such a logical framework for instances of "violence against works of art,” arguing that “no adequate recognition exists for the harm caused by vandalistic attacks on objects which, unlike other tangible property, are valued both for their uniqueness and for their public significance."
    + In context
      + At the time that Malevich painted some of his most acclaimed works, the USSR was pushing an entirely disparate aesthetic known as Social Realism
      + It's straight forward style with workers positioned as heroes made it ripe for propaganda
      + For many ruling communists in Russia, Malevich and the avant-garde were seen as an extension of bourgeois ideology, and that such works of art were inaccessible to those without a knowledge of history and art
      + Malevich saw things differently and argued that "the visual phenomena of the objective world are in themselves meaningless; the significant thing is feeling"
      + Artist and critic Ane Hjort Guttu wrote "One could ... compare Malevich's relationship to Rembrandt and Rubens with Brener's relationship to Malevich: he despairingly watched his beloved works of art reduced to commodities by the art market and the museum institution. While Malevich chose to establish 'his own art', Suprematism, as a response, Brener took action directly against the museum. As opposed to most other historical cases of vandalism against art however, Brener was not provoked by the work of art itself, only by the physical and economic context in which it was located. Brener identified with Malevich and sought to 'blend his paint' with the artist's. Spray-painting the work of art was Brener's way of taking it seriously."
      + It is important to remember that the USSR beat the United States, and all other nations, to space. It was for many years the global superpower.
      + The adjusted monetary value of Suprematism is approx $65 million, the most expensive piece of Russian art ever sold. The most expensive painting ever sold (until recently) was Pollock's No.5 for 161 million. Both paintings were sold within weeks of each other at Sotheby's in New York City
      + Art historian Pat Simpson said that Brener and his peers "seemed to locate the source of their alienation in experiences of marginality relative to the Western Art World, as a specific aspect of post-Soviet economic conditions, and to place their art practices in a critical relation to these conditions... Brener defined the Eastern, and particularly the Russian artist as having been relegated to Third World status"
      + Oleg Kulik titled one of his performances "To Bite or to Lick?" which Simpson believes to be interpretable as "whether to sek easy incorporation into the Western art market, or to refuse this and stay on the margins, seeking a separate artistic identity."
      + The history of contemporary art, over the past few decades, is a history of art being absorbed into a market. This configuration ensures that cultural works conform to the logic of market values, both in form and content.
      + In this sense, one can view Brener's actions as having rescued Malevich's painting from its capitalist context. The vandalized painting was removed from the marketplace, if only for a moment, due to its damaged condition, instead occupying a site defined by Brener. For a moment, it was interpretable and communicable in a manner that was outside the dictates of Western capitalism.


## Questions
+ What or who is being protected against "art vandalism"? The original author of the painting? The current owner, their private property? The autonomous art object itself? The public that supposedly benefits from its imperforate existence?
