  + America didn't become super relevant in the world stage of culture until after the first World War, and didn't become dominant in this regard until after the second world war
  + The history of Western art, of course, was centered in Europe. And the center of abstract expressionism, the newest and most important art movement of the 1900s was centered in Russia
  + The reception of American art in opposition to that of the USSR was thought to be so important that the CIA made it a guiding principal when it was founded in 1947
  + Once the Soviet Union dissolved the artists there went from being at the center of cultural production to irrelevant, as the market became the deciding factor in the relevance of culture in place of art historians or alternative economic models (such as with the USSR)
  + This leads to artists coming out of a historic avant-garde tradition in drastically shifting cultural paradigms, challenging the supremacy of an emerging market-driven art
