# Monday

## Final Exhibition

+ What are people showing? How much space do you need? What are your equipment needs?
	+ If you have equipment needs, have you been in touch with AV?

+ Where? Hall or Media Lab? With Hall itâ€™s much harder to get equipment set up, so people would need to help with that.

+ Tasks
	+ Creating a vinyl for the wall?
	+ Statement for the work?
	+ Promotion?
	+ Grayson: Get pizza?

+ False Documents class may want to participate

+ Check-in, how is everyone doing on their project?

+ There won't be any group "crit" for the final projects, though I will give you feedback on Blackboard. I encourage you all to speak to one another during the Art Walk about the work
