### Presentation: World Extruding

Shobun Baile will discuss his research and art practice as they relate to spatial technologies.

The organization and control of space is a major part of contemporary human infrastructures. With every apartment building, prison, and nation-state come the requirements for planning and problem solving, for dealing with questions of scalability, efficiency, ethics, and capital. Through this lens I will discuss several projects that explore when and why plans become form, and the role that these moments of formalization play in the embedding of power and ideology into material. I will also discuss my working process, which deals with engaging voices, institutions, tools, and protocols involved in the realization of buildings, cities, and nation-states.
