# Problems: Creative Interventions Online and IRL - Art044

# When / Where / Who

+ Monday/Wednesday 7-10pm
+ Media Lab ~~
+ Professor Grayson Earle
+ Office Hours: Tuesday 1:15 - 4:15 and by appointment

Producing culture in public space is a means of provoking critical dialogue about the political conditions surrounding us. At times, art can move beyond dialogic production and engage systems directly. In this course students will examine and reproduce interventionist strategies invoked by critical artists and technologists. Varied tools will be used to this end, as we will be moving between online and offline sites of public engagement. This class is a studio/seminar hybrid, so students should be prepared to read, discuss, create, and critique.

## Readings

Each week, a student or group of students will present an assigned text and lead a discussion. When leading a text and discussion, here are some guiding principles:

+ Leading an insightful discussion about specific concepts that you think are important from the text
+ Proposing fundamental questions about the text
+ Putting forward inventive and/or alternative ideas and theory for discussion
+ Experimenting with the form of presentation
+ Generating excitement about the ideas in the text

It is imperative that all students come to class having done the readings and thought about them in a critical manner. The students that are not leading the discussions for the week will be responsible for the following:

+ Submitting a short written response to each reading via Blackboard
+ Coming to class with questions and/or perspectives that you would like to discuss
+ Presenting these questions and perspectives in class

I will be available to guide lead groups in their proposed activity and assist you in highlighting and clarifying ideas.

## Projects

1. Psychogeography

This project is lifted from a quote in Malcolm Coverly’s book Psychogeography.

> Psychogeography: a beginner’s guide. Unfold a street map of London [New York City], place a glass, rim down, anywhere on the map, and draw round its edge. Pick up the map, go out into the city, and walk the circle, keeping as close as you can to the curve. Record the experience as you go, in whatever medium you favour: film, photograph, manuscript, tape. Catch the textual run-off of the streets; the graffiti, the branded litter, the snatches of conversation. Cut for sign. Log the data-stream. Be alert to the happenstance of metaphors, watch for visual rhymes, coincidences, analogies, family resemblances, the changing moods of the street. Complete the circle, and the record ends. Walking makes for content; footage for footage.

—Robert MacFarlane, A Road of One’s Own.

2. Unnoticed

Introduce something into public space that, while possessing meaning, is meant to go unnoticed. Document the creation of the object as well as it in public space. You will be required to show this documentation during a group discussion. In developing this work I encourage you to think about spaces, ideas, and objects that are intended to be invisible.

3. Visual Reclamation

Using projection mapping or another visual medium, design and produce an intervention on public visual space.
